NOSTALGIACONV | PROTO CONVERSION EXPLOIT.

    THIS SOURCE DOES NOT INCLUDE CALLCHECK / RETCHECK BYPASS, MOST REVIVALS HAVE IT BROKEN ANYWAYS. IF YOU DO ENCOUNTER IT YOU CAN CLONE FUNC AND REMOVE IT (ETERNALS METHOD),
    OR YOU CAN SPOOF IT VIA SOME ASSEMBLY. I WILL NOT GO OVER HOW TO DO THAT, OR HOW TO UPDATE THIS CHEAT BUT IT SHOULD BE SELF EXPLANATORY. THIS SOURCE WAS MADE FOR FUN, AND DOESN'T
    NECESSARILY MEAN IT IS A GOOD CHEAT BASE TO USE, BUT IT CAN BE MADE BETTER BY ADDING SCHEDULER. I DID SCANNING BECAUSE OF NOSTALGIA FROM WHEN I USED TO SCAN FOR THE SCRIPT CONTEXT.
    THERE IS NO DEBUG INFORMATION IN THIS EITHER, MAINLY DUE TO NOT WANTING TO UPDATE THAT.

    A COUPLE THINGS WOULD NEED TO BE MODIFIED TO MAKE THIS A NEAR 100% STABILITY RATE. RIGHT NOW IT HAS INSTABILITY BUT ONLY ON INJECTION, NOT ON EXECUTION. READ MY COMMENTS TO UNDERSTAND
    HOW THIS SOURCE WORKS. THE ENCRYPTION ROBLOX USES I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. I SIMPLY MADE SOME CONSTRAINTS AND BRUTEFORCE IT, IN AN EFFICIENT WAY BUT IT'S STILL SLOW. SOMEBODY ACTUALLY
    POSTED ABOUT ROBLOX'S ENCRYPTION ON A MATH FORUM A LONG TIME AGO (2016). I SOLVED THE ENCRYPTION MYSELF WITHOUT ANYTHING FOR FUN AND TO LEARN A BIT ABOUT THE MATH. AFTERWARDS, I DECIDED
    TO READ ABOUT THE ENCRYPTION. THIS LINK CONTAINS THE DETAILED MATH BEHIND IT: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1884500/how-to-solve-this-equation-for-x-with-xor-involved

    IF YOU ARE CURIOUS ABOUT THEIR INSTRUCTION ENCRYPTION AND HOW THEY CAN MULTIPLY WITHOUT A DIVIDE, IT'S CALLED A MODULAR MULTIPLICATIVE INVERSE, IT'S QUITE AN INTERESTING TOPIC. I MAINLY MADE
    THIS CHEAT TO ACTUALLY LEARN THE MATH BEHIND THEIR OLD ENCRYPTION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY COOL.

    IF YOU NEED HELP UPDATING THE LUAC FUNCTIONS HERE IS A HELPFUL RESOURCE: https://pastebin.com/raw/4bRhbNR0

    THIS ENTIRE CHEAT WAS WRITTEN FROM SCRATCH BY ME, NOTHING WAS REFERENCED AND NO OTHER SOURCES WERE USED BESIDES THE LUA SOURCE, WHICH I MODIFIED TO WORK WITH THE CLIENTS INSTRUCTION FORMAT.
    THE WINDOW CODE WAS MADE COURTESY OF CHATGPT SINCE WIN32 API IS HORRIBLE TO USE. I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU USE IT, CONSIDERING HOW LIMITED IT IS AND HOW MUCH EFFORT IT IS FOR A SIMPLE WINDOW.
    THE UNHANDLED EXCEPTION FILTER USES A WINDOWS SPECIFIC OFFSET, YOU WILL NEED TO REVERSE KERNELBASE.SetUnhandledExceptionFilter FOR THIS OFFSET.

    THIS SOURCE IS NO LONGER USEFUL IN THE MODERN YEAR UNLESS YOU ARE CHEATING ON AN OLD REVIVAL CLIENT (2013-2019 I believe). THIS ONE WAS SPECIFICALLY MADE FOR 2016. IT IS DESIGNED AS A
    LEARNING MATERIAL AND SOMETHING TO TINKER WITH. LOUKA WROTE SOME EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTS ON PROTO CONVERSION, AND A COUPLE OTHER EXECUTION METHODS HERE: https://github.com/Fish-Sticks/LoukaPDF

    THERE IS NO ELEVATED IDENTITY, I'LL LEAVE IT AS AN EXERCISE FOR YOU!

    LUA5.1 DOCUMENTATION: https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/
    A GUIDE ON THE LUA VM INTERNALS, THIS WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND PROTO CONVERSION: https://archive.org/details/a-no-frills-intro-to-lua-5.1-vm-instructions

    BY READING ALL THESE RESOURCES AND SOME REVERSE ENGINEERING YOU WILL COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO PROTO CONVERSION ON YOUR OWN, NOT ONLY FOR THIS CLIENT BUT FOR ANY LUA GAME YOU WANT.
    BACK IN 2016 A CHEAT LIKE THIS WOULD COST ~$40 USD.

    YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHY I'D SPEND SO MUCH TIME MAKING A CHEAT FOR AN OLDER CLIENT? WELL I CODED THIS IN A DAY, IT TOOK ME MANY HOURS OF THE DAY BUT STILL ONLY A DAY. IT PROBABLY WON'T
    BE UPDATED UNLESS YOU PAY ME, SINCE I DON'T ENJOY UPDATING. I MADE THIS CHEAT BECAUSE I NEVER GOT TO EXPERIENCE CHEATING ON THE OLD VM. MANY TOLD ME IT WAS VERY HARD, AND THAT LUAU IS A
    LOT EASIER TO CHEAT ON. WHILE THIS IS TRUE, MY SKILL IS SIMPLY WAY BETTER THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND I DIDN'T STRUGGLE WITH THIS VM AT ALL. I ALWAYS WANTED TO EXPERIENCE CHEATING ON THE OLD
    VM AND I HAVE FINALLY GOT THE CHANCE TO DO IT. I'VE ALSO WRITTEN LUAU TRANSPILERS BEFORE LUAU WAS OPEN SOURCE, AND THAT WAS QUITE FUN TOO, BUT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT SINCE WE HAD TO DEAL
    WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUCTIONS. THIS WAS A FUN EXPERIENCE AND FUN TO MAKE, IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING UR OWN TRY OUT MAKING A CLVM, IT'S A LITTLE HARDER BUT MORE FUN. I'VE NEVER ENJOYED
    MAKING BYTECODE CONVERSION EXPLOITS BECAUSE I LIKE TO GET LOW INTO THE VM AND HAVE CONTROL OVER EVERYTHING START TO FINISH.

    HAVE FUN!
